# Little Coding Exercises

Various programming challenges i've completed- most of them from github repositories or r/dailyprogrammer.
These are written in either Python or C++. 
A lot of them are not very good because they were completed when I had first started learning.
I'll probably update them at some point.

- 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall

- Make a random password generator (Python)

- Pig Latin Translator

- Generate a new number from an old one by adding 1 to each of its number (done without bonus).
