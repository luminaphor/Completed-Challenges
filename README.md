# Little Coding Exercises

Various programming challenges i've completed- most of them from github repositories or r/dailyprogrammer.
These are written in Python. Some day i'll get around to doing them in C++ as well.
A lot of them are not very good because they were completed when I had first started learning.
I'll probably update them at some point.
